Deadlock avoidance using banker's algorithm

In an economic institution consider an electronic's lab where a set of components will be provided to the students to complete their mini project assume that a group of 5 students are currently working on a project in the lab and they require 3 types of components A,B,C to finish the project on that day itself the total quantities of the three components avaiable in the lab are as follows :
A - 10 
B - 7
C - 8

when the students have started doing thier work each student has been provided with initial set of components and remaining will be given later on entry to the lab the students should submit the maximum requirement of components.
WAP in C to implement the banker's algorithm to satisfy the requirements of each student by avoiding the student to wait for indefinite time display the following output on the screen : 
1. Need Matrix
2. Available vector
3. If the system is in the safe state find out the safe sequence

The inital allocation and maximum requirement of each student is given below :

 Student    Allocation         Max
            A   B   C       A   B   C

    S0      1   1   2       5   4   4
    S1      2   1   2       4   3   3
    S2      3   0   1       9   1   3
    S3      0   2   0       8   6   4
    S4      1   1   2       2   2   3
